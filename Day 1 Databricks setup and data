🚀 Day 1 of Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge — Completed!



Today I completed an important milestone in my data journey, and honestly, it feels really good to pause and reflect.



I learned how to:



*Generate and use Kaggle API credentials

*Securely download a large real-world ecommerce dataset (4.3GB) directly into Databricks

*Create schemas and volumes for proper data organization

*Load raw CSV files into Spark DataFrames

*Validate data using row counts, schema checks, and sample queries



What stood out to me the most was understanding why each step matters not just running commands, but knowing how data actually moves from an external source (Kaggle) into a cloud analytics platform like Databricks.



There were errors, restarts, and moments of confusion 😅

But solving them step by step helped me build real confidence with Databricks, Spark, and cloud-based data workflows.



This feels less like “learning tools” and more like learning how data is handled in real companies.
