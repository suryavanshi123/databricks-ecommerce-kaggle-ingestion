📅 Day 6 – Medallion Architecture Implementation

On Day 6, I implemented a Medallion Architecture using PySpark and Delta Lake in Databricks Community Edition.

The goal was to understand how data flows through different layers in a real-world data engineering pipeline.

🏗️ Architecture Design
Raw CSV Data
     ↓
Bronze Layer (Raw Delta)
     ↓
Silver Layer (Cleaned Delta)
     ↓
Gold Layer (Business Aggregates)

🟤 Bronze Layer – Raw Ingestion

Purpose:

Store raw data exactly as received

No transformations or cleaning

Actions performed:

Read raw CSV e-commerce data

Stored it as a Delta table in the Bronze layer

⚪ Silver Layer – Cleaning & Validation

Purpose:

Make data reliable and usable

Actions performed:

Converted price column to proper numeric type

Removed records with missing user information

Stored cleaned data in Silver layer

🟡 Gold Layer – Business Aggregates

Purpose:

Create business-ready datasets for analytics

Actions performed:

Filtered purchase events

Calculated total revenue by product category

Stored aggregated results in Gold layer

🧠 Key Learnings

Medallion architecture helps organize data logically

Each layer has a clear responsibility

Delta Lake ensures reliability across all layers

Gold layer is what BI tools directly consume

🛠️ Tools Used

Databricks Community Edition

PySpark

Delta Lake

✅ Status

✔ Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers implemented
✔ Day 6 completed successfully

📌 Note

All implementations were done considering Databricks Community Edition limitations.
