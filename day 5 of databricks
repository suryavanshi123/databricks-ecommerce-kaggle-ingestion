📅 Day 5 – Delta Lake Advanced Concepts

On Day 5, I explored advanced features of Delta Lake and how they are used in real-world data engineering workflows.

🔹 Topics Covered
1. Time Travel

Learned how Delta Lake keeps track of table versions

Understood how previous versions of data can be queried for auditing and debugging

2. MERGE (Upserts)

Studied how incremental data updates work using MERGE INTO

Understood why MERGE is preferred over full overwrite in production pipelines

3. OPTIMIZE & ZORDER

Learned how OPTIMIZE helps with file compaction

Understood ZORDER for improving query performance on frequently filtered columns

Execution not supported in Databricks Community Edition, so concepts were studied theoretically

4. VACUUM

Learned how VACUUM removes old, unused files

Understood its importance in storage management and performance

🧠 Key Learnings

Delta Lake adds reliability and performance on top of data lakes

MERGE is critical for incremental data processing

Performance tuning concepts are as important as writing correct code

Platform limitations are normal, and understanding concepts matters more

🛠️ Tools Used

Databricks Community Edition

PySpark

Delta Lake

📌 Note

Some advanced operations like OPTIMIZE and ZORDER were studied conceptually due to limitations of Databricks Community Edition.
