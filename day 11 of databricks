📘 Day 11 – Statistical Analysis & ML Prep (Databricks + PySpark)

Objective:
Understand data behavior using statistics and prepare features for machine learning.

✔ What I Did:

Generated statistical summaries for key numerical columns

Compared weekday vs weekend purchase behavior

Identified correlations between numerical features

Engineered ML-ready features:

Binary target variable (is_purchase)

Log-scaled price feature (log_price)

Built a clean feature dataset for downstream ML tasks

🧠 Key Takeaway:

Statistical understanding and feature engineering are critical steps before applying any ML model. Clean, meaningful features matter more than complex algorithms.
