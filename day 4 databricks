📅 Day 4 — Delta Lake Introduction
📌 Objective

The goal of Day 4 was to understand Delta Lake fundamentals and apply them practically on an e-commerce dataset using Databricks.

📚 Concepts Covered

What is Delta Lake

Difference between Delta vs Parquet

ACID transactions in big data

Schema enforcement and data reliability

Databricks storage best practices (Volumes)

🛠️ Hands-on Tasks Performed

Loaded e-commerce CSV data (October & November 2019)

Fixed schema issues (casting price column)

Converted cleaned data into Delta format

Stored Delta data using Databricks Volumes

Read Delta data using PySpark

Created temporary views for SQL analysis

Understood Databricks Community Edition limitations

💻 Key Code Snippets
# Writing data in Delta format
df_full.write \
    .format("delta") \
    .mode("overwrite") \
    .save("/Volumes/workspace/ecommerce/ecommerce_data/delta_ecommerce_events")

# Reading Delta data
df_delta = spark.read.format("delta") \
    .load("/Volumes/workspace/ecommerce/ecommerce_data/delta_ecommerce_events")

# Creating temp view for SQL
df_delta.createOrReplaceTempView("ecommerce_delta")

🔍 Learnings & Observations

Delta Lake ensures data consistency and reliability

Not all storage paths support Delta transactions

Spark DataFrames are session-based and must be recreated after restarts

Temporary views are very useful for SQL analysis in Databricks CE

🚀 Outcome

By the end of Day 4, I gained clarity on how Delta Lake helps in building production-ready data pipelines and why it is preferred over raw file formats.
