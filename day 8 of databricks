📅 Day 08 – Data Governance & Table Management (Databricks)

🎯 Objective

To understand how data is organized, managed, and governed in Databricks using table abstractions, views, and governance concepts inspired by Unity Catalog.

🧱 Core Concepts Learned

Catalog → Schema → Table hierarchy

Difference between managed and external tables

Importance of data access control

Using views to limit data exposure

Conceptual understanding of permissions (GRANT / REVOKE)

🛠️ Implementation Details
1️⃣ Managed Delta Table Creation

Cleaned Silver-layer data was written as a managed Delta table using saveAsTable.
This allows Databricks to manage both metadata and storage.

silver_df.write.format("delta") \
    .mode("overwrite") \
    .saveAsTable("events_table")

2️⃣ Querying the Managed Table
SELECT * FROM events_table LIMIT 5;


This confirms that the table is registered and accessible using SQL.

3️⃣ Views for Controlled Access

To simulate governance and restricted access, a view was created exposing only selected columns.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW events_public AS
SELECT
    event_time,
    event_type,
    category_code,
    price
FROM events_table;


Views help ensure that sensitive data remains hidden while still enabling analytics.

4️⃣ Access Control (Conceptual)

Although permissions were not executed directly, the correct syntax and purpose were studied:

-- Example (Production Environment)
GRANT SELECT
ON TABLE ecommerce_catalog.sales.events
TO analyst_role;

📘 Key Takeaways

Governance is a critical part of data engineering

Managed tables simplify data management

Views are powerful tools for controlled data access

Understanding governance concepts is essential for production systems
