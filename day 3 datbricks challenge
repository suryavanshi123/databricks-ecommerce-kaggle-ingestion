Day 03 – PySpark Transformations Deep Dive

This folder contains my Day 03 work from the 14 Days Databricks AI Challenge, where I explored more advanced PySpark transformations using an e-commerce dataset.

What I did

On Day 3, I focused on understanding how PySpark handles more complex data processing tasks. I worked with multiple months of data and applied transformations that are commonly used in real-world analytics and data engineering projects.

Dataset

E-commerce behavior dataset (October & November 2019)

Data includes user events such as views, cart actions, and purchases

Key columns used: event_type, price, category_code, event_time

Tasks Performed

Combined October and November datasets using union

Performed joins to enrich event data with category information

Applied window functions to:

Rank purchases based on price

Calculate running revenue

Created derived features such as:

High-value purchase indicator

Purchase flag for event classification

Identified and fixed data type issues by casting string columns to numeric types

Key Learnings

Spark treats all CSV columns as strings unless schema is defined

Explicit data type casting is necessary before applying numeric conditions

Window functions are useful for running totals and ranking without collapsing rows

Feature engineering is an important step before analysis or modeling

Notes

This day helped me move beyond basic Spark operations and understand how transformations are applied in practical scenarios. The focus was more on understanding the logic rather than writing complex code.
