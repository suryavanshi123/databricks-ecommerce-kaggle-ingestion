Day 10 – Query Performance & Optimization (Databricks)

This module focuses on understanding query behavior and fixing common Delta Lake issues before applying performance optimizations.

🧠 Key Learnings

How Spark SQL resolves tables and schemas

Why Delta tables may exist without columns

Importance of schema validation before querying

How EXPLAIN helps analyze query execution plans

Practical debugging of real Databricks errors

🛠️ Tasks Completed
1️⃣ Table Validation

Listed available tables using SHOW TABLES

Checked schema using DESCRIBE

Identified a Delta table with missing schema

2️⃣ Fixing Broken Delta Table

Dropped the incorrect table

Recreated it by writing data with schema

Used mergeSchema = true to register columns properly

3️⃣ Query Plan Analysis

Executed EXPLAIN on filtered queries

Observed how Spark plans scans and filters

Understood why schema correctness impacts performance

📂 Outcome

Queries now execute successfully

Execution plans are visible and understandable

Table is ready for partitioning and optimization

🔑 Key Takeaway

Performance tuning is not about commands first —
it starts with correct schema, clean tables, and understanding execution plans.
