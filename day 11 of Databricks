Day 11 – Statistical Analysis & Feature Engineering

Objective:
Prepare cleaned data for machine learning by applying basic statistical analysis and feature engineering.

What I Learned

Spark supports correlation only for numeric columns

String columns must be encoded before analysis

Log transformation helps handle skewed numerical data

Feature engineering is a critical step before ML modeling

Tasks Performed

Generated descriptive statistics using summary()

Created a binary feature (is_purchase) from event types

Applied log transformation on price values

Ran correlation analysis on engineered numerical features

Key Takeaway

This exercise helped me understand how data moves from raw events to meaningful numerical features, which is a core step in real-world ML pipelines.
